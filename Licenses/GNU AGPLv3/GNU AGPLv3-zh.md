### GNU AFFERO 通用公共许可协议

第 3 版，2017 年 11 月 19 日

版权所有 © 自由软件基金会 <https://fsf.org/>

任何人都可以复制和分发该许可协议文件的完整版本，但不能对其进行修改。

### 序言

GNU AFFERO 通用公共许可协议（以下简称“GNU AGPL协议”）是一份针对软件及其他类型作品的自由的、公共的许可，同时对于确保基于网络服务器软件的社区合作作出了明确要求。

大多数软件及其他作品的许可协议都禁止你分享和修改这些作品。相比之下，GNU 通用公共许可协议旨在保证您可以分享、修改一个程序的所有版本——确保该软件对所有用户都是自由的。

当我们谈及自由软件（free software），我们指的是自由（freedom），而不是免费（price）。GNU 通用公共许可协议保证您有分发自由软件（如果愿意也可以为此服务收费）的自由，以确保您可以在需要的时候获得这些源码，确保您可以修改这些作品或在新的自由软件中复用一些片段，确保您对以上权利知情。

使用 GNU 通用公共许可协议的开发者通过以下两步保障个人权益：（1）声明软件的版权；（2）提供本协议以确保您可以合法地复制、分发、修改该软件。

维护所有使用者自由的另一个好处是，如果一个软件的被广泛使用，各版本分支的改进可以被开发者们合并起来。许多开发者都会被由此产生的合作所鼓舞。然而，在网络服务器上使用的软件，这可能就无法实现。GNU 通用公共许可协议允许您修改版本并让公众在服务器上访问它而不对公众提供给它的源码。

GNU AGPL 协议是针对这个问题设计的。在这种情况下，修改后的源码是可以被社区使用的。它要求网络服务器运行者将修改后用于运行的源码提供给该服务器的用户。因此，在公开可访问服务器上运行的修改版本应提供该修改版本源码的公开访问路径。

一个由 Affero 发布的名为“Affero 通用公共许可协议”的较旧版本旨在实现类似的目的。本协议是一个与此不同的协议，并非 Affero GPL 的另一个版本，但是 Affero 已经发布了一个 Affero GPL 的新版本允许在本协议下进行重新许可。

关于复制、分发和修改的正式条款如下。

### 条款

#### 0. 定义

“本许可协议”指GNU AGPL协议第3版。

“版权”也指适用于诸如半导体掩模之类的其他种类作品的类似法律。

“本程序”指 本协议下的任何获得版权的作品。每个许可获得者都被称为“您”。“许可获得者”和“接受者”可以是个人，也可以是组织。

“修改”工作指以需要版权许可的方式复制作品或修改作品的全部/局部。和制作一个副本有区别。“修改”工作最终会产生一个早期作品的“修改版”，或是一个“基于”前作的作品。

“受保护作品”指源程序或其衍生作品。

“传播”作品指在没有被许可的情况下，用它做任何事都会让你直接或间接地承担版权法律法规所规定的侵权行为（在计算机上运行程序及私下修改除外）。传播包括复制、分发（无论修改与否）、向公众公开以及在某些国家的一些其他行为。

“转发”作品指任何能使他人能制作或接受作品副本的传播方式。仅仅是通过计算机网络和某个用户的不包含传输副本的合作互动，便不是转发。

采用交互式用户界面显示“适当的法律声明”时应包含以下便捷而明显的可视化特性：（1）显示适当的版权提示；（2）告知用户该作品没有品质担保（提供担保的情况除外），许可获得者可以在本许可协议约束下转发该作品。如果该界面含有一个用户命令/选项列表（比如菜单栏），其表单项目应符合以上规范。

#### 1. 源码

作品的“源码”指对作品进行修改的首选形式。“目标码”指除源码外的其他作品形式。

“标准接口”指被标准化组织定义的官方标准接口，或为开发者广泛使用的针对特定编程语言设定的接口。

可执行作品中的“系统库”并非指整个作品，而是指以下内容：（a）和主要组件打包到一起，但非主要组件的一部分；（b）和主要组件一同使作品可用，或用于实现某个已有公开实现源码的标准接口。以上提及的“主要组件”指可运行作品运行所依赖的的特定操作系统中的主要组成部分（内核、窗口系统等），或是用于生成作品的编译器，或是运行目标码的解释器。

目标码形式作品的“相应源码”指生成、安装、运行（对于可执行作品而言）目标码以及修改作品（包括控制上述行为的脚本）所需的所有源码。然而，它并不包括该作品的系统库、通用工具、未经修改即可支持以上行为而非该作品一部分的普遍可用的自由软件。例如：相应源码包含与源文件关联的接口定义文件、作品所依赖的共享库和动态链接子程序的源码（依赖指作品和子程序间密切的数据通信或控制流）。

相应源码不需包含用户可以通过该相应源码的其他部分自动生成的内容。

源码形式作品的相应源码即为本身。

#### 2. 基本许可

本许可协议下授予的所有权利都是就本程序的版权而言的，并且在满足所属条件时是不可撤销的。本许可协议明确保证您不受限制地运行未修改版程序的权限。仅当受保护作品的输出内容构成一个受保护作品时，才为本许可协议所约束。如版权法内所规定，本许可协议承认您正当使用的权利及与之等价的权利。

只要你的许可协议仍然有效，你便可以制作、运行和传播那些你不能转发的受保护作品。只要你遵从本许可协议中转发时不占用其版权的条款，你就可以转发该受保护作品给他人，仅为让他们给你开发定制或向你提供给运行这些作品的工具。因此，那些为你制作或运行受保护作品的人，必须在你的指导和控制下，谨代表你工作，禁止他们在双方关系之外制作任何你提供的受版权保护的材料的副本。

在其他任何情况下，转发当且仅当满足后文所述条件时才被允许。转授许可协议是不允许的，而第10条的存在也使转授许可协议毫无必要。

#### 3. 保护用户合法权益免受反规避法限制

根据任何履行1996年12月20日通过的WIPO版权条约第11条的适用法律，或相似的禁止/限制规避此类措施的法律，任何受保护作品都不应被视为有效技术手段的一部分。

当你转发一个受保护作品时，你将放弃任何可以禁止规避技术措施的合法权利，乃至通过本许可协议行使权利获得的规避。同时你要表明无意限制用户操作或修改作品来确保你方或第三方禁止规避技术措施的合法权利。

### 4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.

You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
keep intact all notices stating that 本许可协议 and any
non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
接受者 a copy of 本许可协议 along with the Program.

You may charge any price or no price for each copy that you convey,
and you may offer support or warranty protection for a fee.

#### 5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.

You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these
conditions:

-   a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
    it, and giving a relevant date.
-   b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
    released under 本许可协议 and any conditions added under
    section 7. This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4
    to "keep intact all notices".
-   c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
    License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy. This
    License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
    additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
    regardless of how they are packaged. 本许可协议 gives no
    permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
    invalidate such permission if you have separately received it.
-   d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
    Appropriate Legal Notices; however, if the Program has interactive
    interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
    work need not make them do so.

A compilation of a 受保护作品 with other separate and independent
works, which are not by their nature extensions of the 受保护作品,
and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
"aggregate" if the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
beyond what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a 受保护作品
in an aggregate does not cause 本许可协议 to apply to the other
parts of the aggregate.

#### 6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.

You may convey a 受保护作品 in object code form under the terms of
sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the machine-readable
Corresponding Source under the terms of 本许可协议, in one of these
ways:

-   a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
    Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
    customarily used for software interchange.
-   b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
    (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
    written offer, valid for at least three years and valid for as
    long as you offer spare parts or customer support for that product
    model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
    copy of the Corresponding Source for all the software in the
    product that is covered by 本许可协议, on a durable physical
    medium customarily used for software interchange, for a price no
    more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
    conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the Corresponding
    Source from a network server at no charge.
-   c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
    written offer to provide the Corresponding Source. This
    alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
    only if you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
    with subsection 6b.
-   d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
    place (gratis or for a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
    Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
    further charge. You need not require 接受者 to copy the
    Corresponding Source along with the object code. If the place to
    copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
    may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
    that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
    clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
    Corresponding Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
    Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
    available for as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
-   e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission,
    provided you inform other peers where the object code and
    Corresponding Source of the work are being offered to the general
    public at no charge under subsection 6d.

A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
included in conveying the object code work.

A "User Product" is either (1) a "consumer product", which means any
tangible personal property which is normally used for personal,
family, or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold for
incorporation into a dwelling. In determining whether a product is a
consumer product, doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of
coverage. For a particular product received by a particular user,
"normally used" refers to a typical or common use of that class of
product, regardless of the status of the particular user or of the way
in which the particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
to use, the product. A product is a consumer product regardless of
whether the product has substantial commercial, industrial or
non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent the only significant
mode of use of the product.

"Installation Information" for a User Product means any methods,
procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to
install and execute modified versions of a 受保护作品 in that User
Product from a modified version of its Corresponding Source. The
information must suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of
the modified object code is in no case prevented or interfered with
solely because modification has been made.

If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
specifically for use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
by the Installation Information. But this requirement does not apply
if neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
modified object code on the User Product (for example, the work has
been installed in ROM).

The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
requirement to continue to provide support service, warranty, or
updates for a work that has been modified or installed by the
recipient, or for the User Product in which it has been modified or
installed. Access to a network may be denied when the modification
itself materially and adversely affects the operation of the network
or violates the rules and protocols for communication across the
network.

Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
source code form), and must require no special password or key for
unpacking, reading or copying.

#### 7. Additional Terms.

"Additional permissions" are terms that supplement the terms of this
License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
be treated as though they were included in 本许可协议, to the extent
that they are valid under applicable law. If additional permissions
apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
本许可协议 without regard to the additional permissions.

When you convey a copy of a 受保护作品, you may at your option
remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
it. (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
removal in certain cases when you modify the work.) You may place
additional permissions on material, added by you to a 受保护作品,
for which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.

Notwithstanding any other provision of 本许可协议, for material you
add to a 受保护作品, you may (if authorized by the copyright holders
of that material) supplement the terms of 本许可协议 with terms:

-   a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
    terms of sections 15 and 16 of 本许可协议; or
-   b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
    author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
    Notices displayed by works containing it; or
-   c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material,
    or requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
    reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
-   d) Limiting the use for publicity purposes of names of licensors
    or authors of the material; or
-   e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law for use of some
    trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
-   f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
    material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions
    of it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient,
    for any liability that these contractual assumptions directly
    impose on those licensors and authors.

All other non-permissive additional terms are considered "further
restrictions" within the meaning of section 10. If the Program as you
received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
governed by 本许可协议 along with a term that is a further
restriction, you may remove that term. If a license document contains
a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
License, you may add to a 受保护作品 material governed by the terms
of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
not survive such relicensing or conveying.

If you add terms to a 受保护作品 in accord with this section, you
must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
where to find the applicable terms.

Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions; the
above requirements apply either way.

#### 8. Termination.

You may not propagate or modify a 受保护作品 except as expressly
provided under 本许可协议. Any attempt otherwise to propagate or
modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
本许可协议 (including any patent licenses granted under the third
paragraph of section 11).

However, if you cease all violation of 本许可协议, then your license
from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally,
unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally
terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to
60 days after the cessation.

Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the
violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
received notice of violation of 本许可协议 (for any work) from that
copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
your receipt of the notice.

Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
本许可协议. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses for the same
material under section 10.

#### 9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.

You are not required to accept 本许可协议 in order to receive or run
a copy of the Program. Ancillary propagation of a 受保护作品
occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance. However,
nothing other than 本许可协议 grants you permission to propagate or
modify any 受保护作品. These actions infringe copyright if you do
not accept 本许可协议. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
受保护作品, you indicate your acceptance of 本许可协议 to do so.

#### 10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream 接受者.

Each time you convey a 受保护作品, the recipient automatically
receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
propagate that work, subject to 本许可协议. You are not responsible
for enforcing compliance by third parties with 本许可协议.

An "entity transaction" is a transaction transferring control of an
organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
organization, or merging organizations. If propagation of a covered
work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, if
the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.

You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
rights granted or affirmed under 本许可协议. For example, you may
not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge for exercise of
rights granted under 本许可协议, and you may not initiate litigation
(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering for
sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.

#### 11. Patents.

A "contributor" is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based. The
work thus licensed is called the contributor's "contributor version".

A contributor's "essential patent claims" are all patent claims owned
or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
by 本许可协议, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
consequence of further modification of the contributor version. For
purposes of this definition, "control" includes the right to grant
patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
本许可协议.

Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
propagate the contents of its contributor version.

In the following three paragraphs, a "patent license" is any express
agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
(such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
sue for patent infringement). To "grant" such a patent license to a
party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
patent against the party.

If you convey a 受保护作品, knowingly relying on a patent license,
and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available for anyone
to copy, free of charge and under the terms of 本许可协议, through a
publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
patent license for this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
consistent with the requirements of 本许可协议, to extend the patent
license to downstream 接受者. "Knowingly relying" means you have
actual knowledge that, but for the patent license, your conveying the
受保护作品 in a country, or your recipient's use of the 受保护作品
in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
country that you have reason to believe are valid.

If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
受保护作品, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
receiving the 受保护作品 authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
or convey a specific copy of the 受保护作品, then the patent license
you grant is automatically extended to all 接受者 of the covered
work and works based on it.

A patent license is "discriminatory" if it does not include within the
scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on
the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are specifically
granted under 本许可协议. You may not convey a 受保护作品 if you
are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is in the
business of distributing software, under which you make payment to the
third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying the
work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the parties
who would receive the 受保护作品 from you, a discriminatory patent
license (a) in connection with copies of the 受保护作品 conveyed by
you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily for and in
connection with specific products or compilations that contain the
受保护作品, unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.

Nothing in 本许可协议 shall be construed as excluding or limiting
any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
otherwise be available to you under applicable patent law.

#### 12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.

If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of 本许可协议, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of 本许可协议. If you cannot convey a
受保护作品 so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under
本许可协议 and any other pertinent obligations, then as a
consequence you may not convey it at all. For example, if you agree to
terms that obligate you to collect a royalty for further conveying
from those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you could
satisfy both those terms and 本许可协议 would be to refrain entirely
from conveying the Program.

#### 13. Remote Network Interaction; Use with the GNU General Public License.

Notwithstanding any other provision of 本许可协议, if you modify the
Program, your modified version must prominently offer all users
interacting with it remotely through a computer network (if your
version supports such interaction) an opportunity to receive the
Corresponding Source of your version by providing access to the
Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge, through some
standard or customary means of facilitating copying of software. This
Corresponding Source shall include the Corresponding Source for any
work covered by version 3 of the GNU General Public License that is
incorporated pursuant to the following paragraph.

Notwithstanding any other provision of 本许可协议, you have
permission to link or combine any 受保护作品 with a work licensed
under version 3 of the GNU General Public License into a single
combined work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of this
License will continue to apply to the part which is the 受保护作品,
but the work with which it is combined will remain governed by version
3 of the GNU General Public License.

#### 14. Revised Versions of 本许可协议.

The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the GNU Affero General Public License from time to time. Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Affero General
Public License "or any later version" applies to it, you have the
option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of the
GNU Affero General Public License, you may choose any version ever
published by the Free Software Foundation.

If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions
of the GNU Affero General Public License can be used, that proxy's
public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
to choose that version for the Program.

Later license versions may give you additional or different
permissions. However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
later version.

#### 15. Disclaimer of Warranty.

THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE
DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

#### 16. Limitation of Liability.

IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR
CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT
NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR
LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM
TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

#### 17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.

If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
copy of the Program in return for a fee.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

### How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively state
the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

        <one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
        Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

        This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify
        it under the terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as
        published by the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the
        License, or (at your option) any later version.

        This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
        but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
        MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
        GNU Affero General Public License for more details.

        You should have received a copy of the GNU Affero General Public License
        along with this program.  If not, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

If your software can interact with users remotely through a computer
network, you should also make sure that it provides a way for users to
get its source. For example, if your program is a web application, its
interface could display a "Source" link that leads users to an archive
of the code. There are many ways you could offer source, and different
solutions will be better for different programs; see section 13 for
the specific requirements.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. For more information on this, and how to apply and follow
the GNU AGPL, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.
